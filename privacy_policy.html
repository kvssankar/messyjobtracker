    <h1>Privacy Policy for Messy Job Tracker</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 5, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the "Messy Job Tracker" Chrome Extension ("the Extension", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and stores information when you use our Extension.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>The Messy Job Tracker Extension is designed to help you organize and track your job applications from your Gmail account. To provide its functionality, the Extension collects and processes certain information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Account Information:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>When you sign in using your Google account, we request access to your email address (<code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email</code>). This is used solely to identify your Google account for authentication and to display your email address within the Extension for your convenience.</li>
                <li>We request read-only access to your Gmail messages (<code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly</code>). This permission is used <strong>exclusively</strong> to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identify emails related to job applications.</li>
                        <li>Extract relevant information such as sender, subject, and date from emails to categorize and display job application progress within the Extension.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The Extension processes this data to identify and categorize job applications based on the content and metadata of your emails.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Locally Stored Data:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Excluded Domains:</strong> You can specify email domains to exclude from tracking. This list is stored <strong>locally within your browser's Chrome storage</strong>. This data is not transmitted to our servers or any third party.</li>
                <li><strong>Application Tracking Data:</strong> Information derived from your Gmail (e.g., application status, company names, dates) is processed and displayed within the Extension. This processed data is also stored <strong>locally within your browser's Chrome storage</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>No data processed or stored by the Extension is ever transmitted to our servers.</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>All data collected and processed by the Messy Job Tracker Extension is used <strong>solely</strong> for the purpose of providing and improving the Extension's core functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To authenticate you with your Google account.</li>
        <li>To read your Gmail messages to identify and track job applications.</li>
        <li>To display relevant job application information within the Extension's interface.</li>
        <li>To allow you to manage a list of domains to exclude from tracking.</li>
        <li>To enhance your user experience by organizing your job application process directly within your browser.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do not use your data for advertising, marketing, or any purpose other than providing the Messy Job Tracker functionality.</strong></p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All your data processed by the Extension (excluding data residing on Google's servers) is stored <strong>locally within your browser's Chrome storage</strong>. This means the data never leaves your device and is not stored on any external servers operated by us.</li>

While we don't store your data on external servers, the Extension is built with security best practices to ensure your local data is handled responsibly within the browser environment.
